The goal of this Python program is to create a habit tracker that records what I need to do, in order to have more clarity about the daily habits I want to maintain. I created this program to stay more focused on my learning and daily activities.
In this way, I can monitor my progress and have an overview of my performance over time. By giving myself a score and feedback on my daily satisfaction, and by using a graph to track these scores, I can aim to be more satisfied tomorrow than I was today, or at least keep track of what makes me feel good and identify what I can do to improve the following day.

The program starts with a welcome sentence and a menu where we can choose different options depending on what we want to do<img width="1017" height="313" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2465a085-cbef-4c5c-a660-ae613aab1d72" />

The first option is to add a new habit. For example, I chose ‚Äòwake up at 7am,‚Äô and when we press Enter, the terminal gives us feedback confirming that the habit has been added. Then it asks if we want to add another entry. If yes, we type the new habit; if we just press Enter without writing anything, the process of adding habits is finished

(I‚Äôll then show option number two, where I delete the habit I just created.)
For the third option, we have ‚Äúrename.‚Äù First, the terminal shows us the list of activities so we can see all the names. Then we type the one we want to rename and enter the new name. This option changes the name of the habit, while all the records associated with that habit remain saved.

Option number 4 is ‚Äúview active habits.‚Äù It simply shows all the habits that are currently active and available for us to modify.

Option number 5 is the core of our program: we can fill out our diary!
We type ‚Äúy‚Äù or ‚Äún‚Äù depending on whether we completed the activity that day. The diary gives us a compliment if we fulfilled it, or a bit of encouragement if we didn‚Äôt, along with a reminder to do better tomorrow.

If we type a different thing from "y" or "n", maybe for a little error when we type, the terminal will correct and invite us to type the right word, in this way it doesn't create errors or misunderstanding when we save the program.

When we finished to fill out all the activities present in the diary, we can insert a satisfaction score based on our feeling for the day just spent.
Then, a part of the score we can insert a report about the day, we can type if we are proud or less about the day spent, or tell what we did, what makes us happy or sad; in this way we can record our feeling.

Now i jump to the number 8 option, because it's related to the score and the report we've given. Here we find a plot which record all our satisfaction score, so we can have under control our mood and replicate when we have a good day, or improve our bad day. The main goal is get a good score day after day (this is the everyone dream!!üòÅ)

watching the graph, we noticed several points at the height of our score, if we click in one of them, we can see the details about it, for example of the day we added before:
