The goal of this Python program is to create a habit tracker that records what I need to do, in order to have more clarity about the daily habits I want to maintain. I created this program to stay more focused on my learning and daily activities.
In this way, I can monitor my progress and have an overview of my performance over time. By giving myself a score and feedback on my daily satisfaction, and by using a graph to track these scores, I can aim to be more satisfied tomorrow than I was today, or at least keep track of what makes me feel good and identify what I can do to improve the following day.

The program starts with a welcome sentence and a menu where we can choose different options depending on what we want to do

The first option is to add a new habit. For example, I chose ‚Äòwake up at 7am,‚Äô and when we press Enter, the terminal gives us feedback confirming that the habit has been added. Then it asks if we want to add another entry. If yes, we type the new habit; if we just press Enter without writing anything, the process of adding habits is finished.

(I‚Äôll then show option number two, where I delete the habit I just created.)
For the third option, we have ‚Äúrename.‚Äù First, the terminal shows us the list of activities so we can see all the names. Then we type the one we want to rename and enter the new name. This option changes the name of the habit, while all the records associated with that habit remain saved.

Option number 4 is ‚Äúview active habits.‚Äù It simply shows all the habits that are currently active and available for us to modify.

Option number 5 is the core of our program: we can fill out our diary!
We type ‚Äúy‚Äù or ‚Äún‚Äù depending on whether we completed the activity that day. The diary gives us a compliment if we fulfilled it, or a bit of encouragement if we didn‚Äôt, along with a reminder to do better tomorrow.

If we type something different from ‚Äúy‚Äù or ‚Äún‚Äù‚Äîfor example, by making a small typing error, the terminal corrects us and asks us to enter the right input. In this way, no errors or misunderstandings are created when saving the program.

Once we finish filling out all the activities in the diary, we can insert a satisfaction score based on how we felt about the day. Along with the score, we can also write a short report about the day, for example, whether we are proud of it or not, what we did, and what made us happy or sad. This way, we can keep a record of our feelings.

Now I‚Äôll jump to option number 8, because it‚Äôs related to the score and report we entered. Here, we find a plot that records all our satisfaction scores, allowing us to keep track of our mood. This helps us replicate what made us have a good day or improve what made a day less satisfying. The main goal is to achieve a good score day after day (that‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs dream! üòÅ).

Looking at the graph, we notice several points corresponding to our scores. If we click on one of them, we can see the details for that day, for example, the entry we added earlier.

The good thing about the daily report is that there are no limits on what we can type. We can write just a few words or a long sentence, and the yellow box will adapt perfectly to our report.

At point 6 of the menu, we find the habit summary, which shows us a day-by-day recap of what we‚Äôve done so far. It updates daily and tracks our habits with a percentage of consistency. This way, we can easily see where we are more consistent and where we are less.

All habits are saved day by day, and we can visualize them in a plot that grows as new days are added. If we complete an activity, the line goes up; if we don‚Äôt, it remains steady. Moreover, if we add a habit today, the count in the plot and habit summary starts from today, without affecting the previous days. 
At the same time, if we delete a habit, its history will remain saved in both the plot and the habit summary.

Returning to option 2 in the menu, we can delete a habit as well‚Äîand, as mentioned, everything connected to that habit remains saved.

At the end, when we‚Äôve finished filling out our diary and don‚Äôt have any changes to make to our habit tracker, option 9 allows us to close the program. When selected, the program greets us with a friendly message:
