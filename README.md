The goal of this Python program is to create a habit tracker that records what I need to do, in order to have more clarity about the daily habits I want to maintain. I created this program to stay more focused on my learning and daily activities.
In this way, I can monitor my progress and have an overview of my performance over time. By giving myself a score and feedback on my daily satisfaction, and by using a graph to track these scores, I can aim to be more satisfied tomorrow than I was today, or at least keep track of what makes me feel good and identify what I can do to improve the following day.

The program starts with a welcome sentence and a menu where we can choose different options depending on what we want to do<img width="1017" height="313" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2465a085-cbef-4c5c-a660-ae613aab1d72" />

The first option is to add a new habit. For example, I chose ‘wake up at 7am,’ and when we press Enter, the terminal gives us feedback confirming that the habit has been added. Then it asks if we want to add another entry. If yes, we type the new habit; if we just press Enter without writing anything, the process of adding habits is finished

(I'll show then option number two, when I will delete the habit just created)
